Two "low profile" single width CRUVI boards or one double width board can fit inside one VITA 57.1 FMC card.

Note: 
FMC Cards fitted with CRUVI modules are compatible with standard FMC host that can use differential signaling in both directions in all LA pins as well as with host with limited LVDS support (Intel Cyclone V, etc) if the host FMC slots are designed with "CRUVI FMC profile".

When using "translating" FMC2CRUVI card then this restriction does not apply as the translating FPGA can convert the interface to I/O standards that the host does support.
