|Adapter|Status|
|-------|------|
|TOFE 1X full to CRUVI LS passive | Design started |
|TOFE 1X half to CRUVI LS passive | Planned |
|TOFE 1X to CRUVI Smart | Planning, select FPGA ? |

TOFE 1X Motherboards can support CRUVI LS in pure passive mode, full height TOFE 1X card would support one single, dual or tripple width CRUVI LS board.
